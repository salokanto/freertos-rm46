# FreeRTOS for TI RM46

[![N|FreeRTOS](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2944714/25105452/51924cc8-23cd-11e7-94bf-b259e401958e.png)](http://www.freertos.org)

[FreeRTOS] is a real-time operating system kernel for embedded devices.

RM46 is a 32-bit ARM Cortex R4F safety microcontroller family by Texas Instruments ([model comparison][RM4]). The example project is particularly designed to work out-of-the-box on [LAUNCHXL2-RM46] development board ($19.99).

# Purpose
To provide an easy start for RM46 development on up-to-date FreeRTOS.

I created this because the example project in FreeRTOS source tree for RM48 does not really work on the RM46 dev board. The baseline project generated by TI tool [HALCoGen] works, but it is always somewhat out-of-date. Parts of it are still FreeRTOS v7, while the stable is now v9.0.0 and trunk is v9.1.0.

# Content

It's a [Code Composer Studio v7.1.0][ccs] project with most RM46 interface drivers included, and a simple LED blinking task starting from `main()`.

*Todo:* I will add [CAN] and serial communication examples soon.

# Quick Start

Download and install [CCS v7][ccs]. Remember to include support for RM4x.

Click *File* > *Open Projects from File System*. Click *Directory...* and browse to the root of this repo. Click *Finish*.

*Note:* I created the project in Windows and haven't tried it in Linux yet. You might need to fix the path separators in include paths, at least.
